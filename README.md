# Wumpus_World
My first PROLOG program. A Wumpus World game!
<br><br>
To play. From the command line enter the following:
<br>
[initial].  % This loads the initial.pl file, which loads all the necessary files
<br>
start.      % This sets the starting conditions
<br>
agent.      % This launches the Agent to solve the maze
<br><br>
If you want to play manually, instead of entering "agent", you can type in commands yourself.
<br>
'walk(north)', 'shoot_arrow(west)', 'get_gold'
